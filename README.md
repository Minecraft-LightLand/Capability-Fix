# Capability Fix

## How to use:
- After the game runs a while, run `/capabilityfix gather_others`. It will tell you how many times each capability is fetched.
- Open your `latest.log` and find that chat message. Copy it into your config `capabilityfix-common.toml`.
- Run `/capabilityfix reload_config` ingame to apply the config
